## Population Trends for North American Winter Birds Based on Hierarchical Models

Welcome to Group 6's README! Below you will find information about our BIS15L Final Project.

Our project data is sourced from the article [Population Trends for North American Winter Birds Based on Hierarchical Models](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1351) published in 2016. In this study, authors examine 10 biological traits of winter birds from data collected from 1966 to 2013 by the annual Christmas Bird Count (CBC). From these data, we wish to determine the relationship between these life variables in the winter bird family "Emberizidae" to analyze this family's lifestyle and survival tactics. Within our app, you will be able to select a habitat and find out which members of the Emberizidae family are present along with information about their diet, mass, range/migration size, urban tolerance, life expantancy,
